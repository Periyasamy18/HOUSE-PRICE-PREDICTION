# HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION
The "House Price Prediction" project focuses on predicting housing prices using machine learning techniques. By leveraging popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn (sklearn), Matplotlib, Seaborn this project provides an end-to-end solution for accurate price estimation.
# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates house prices based on key features such as the number of bedrooms, the size of the house (area in square feet), and the number of bathrooms. This model can be used by real estate agents, buyers, and sellers to make informed decisions
# Key Features
Data collection:
Gather a dataset containing house prices along with the features: bedrooms, area, and bathrooms.
Sources: Public datasets
Number of Bedrooms: 
The total number of bedrooms in the house.
Area (Square Feet):
The total size of the house in square feet.
Number of Bathrooms:
The total number of bathrooms in the house.
Model Selection:
Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for regression tasks:
Linear Regression
Decision Trees
# Conclousion:
The house price prediction project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to estimate property prices based on key features such as the number of bedrooms, the size of the house (area in square feet), and the number of bathrooms. By leveraging regression models, this project provides valuable insights into the factors influencing house prices and offers a practical tool for stakeholders in the real estate market.
